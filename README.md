## Firebase Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Add project" and follow the setup wizard
3. Choose a project name (e.g., "groot-magazine")

### 2. Enable Required Services

**Authentication:**
1. Go to Authentication > Sign-in method
2. Enable "Email/Password" provider
3. Optionally enable "Google" for easier sign-ins

**Firestore Database:**
1. Go to Firestore Database
2. Click "Create database"
3. Start in "test mode" (we'll configure rules later)
4. Choose a location close to your users

**Storage:**
1. Go to Storage
2. Click "Get started"
3. Start in test mode

### 3. Get Firebase Configuration

1. Go to Project Settings (gear icon)
2. Scroll down to "Your apps"
3. Click "Add app" > Web app
4. Register your app with a name
5. Copy the configuration object

### 4. Update Firebase Config

Replace the config in `src/lib/firebase.ts`:

```typescript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### 5. Configure Security Rules

**Firestore Rules** (Database > Rules):
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read their own profile
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Articles are readable by all, writable by authenticated users
    match /articles/{articleId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Upload logs readable by all authenticated users
    match /uploadLogs/{logId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Site settings only for super admins
    match /settings/{settingId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'super_admin';
    }
  }
}
```

**Storage Rules** (Storage > Rules):
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

2. Try logging in to create a user account
3. In Firebase Console > Authentication > Users
4. Note the User UID of your account
5. Go to Firestore Database > Start collection > "users"
6. Create document with User UID as document ID:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Your Name",
     "email": "your@email.com",
     "role": "super_admin",
     "isActive": true,
     "createdAt": [current timestamp]
   }
   ```
